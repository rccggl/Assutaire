# Assutaire

A solitaire for the CPU.

## Game's rules

Assuntaire is a solitaire perfomed with Italians playing cards (better with the "Napoletane").

Goal of the game is to eliminate all the double cards, reducing the set of 40 cards to 10.

Rules are pretty simple:
* stack the 40 cards
* pickup a card
* place the card on the desk in rows of 5, top -> bottom, left -> right
* if one of the 8 neighbours of the placed card has same value, remove the preceeding double card
* once all cards are in row, you can perform up to 3 permutation in order to achieve the goal.
